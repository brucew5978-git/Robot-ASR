# Automatic Speech Recognition using Wav2vec2

## What is this?

This Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model uses pretrained Wav2Vec2 - a Deep Learning Audio model introduced by Facebook AI Research, which is further finetuned on Timit - an acoustic speech dataset, in order to increase the ASR's effectiveness in speech recognition 

## What is it used for?

This ASR model is intended to be deployed on Trinity Robotics' Storm robot in order to give operation commands - like "go left" for example, using audio input. However, this model is not limited to operations on Storm and can be deployed on any device that supports the necessary requirements. The model can also be quantized to reduce the file size to better suit operations on edge or mobile devices.
